        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I have recently been interested in web development. I have previously studied python web development before switching to front end.</p>
        <p>I had worked as a Fulfillment Associate for Amazon for about 2 months and before that as an Inventory Associate for RGIS for about 10 months.</p>

        <p>I had graduated from University of Maryland, Baltimore County in December 2014 and received my bachelor of science in mathematics in late January/early February 2015.</p>
        <p>I had previously been supposed to graduate in 2013 and had attended the graduation ceremony in May 2013, but due to some circumstances did not graduate until 2014.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master my skills in front end web development and ultimately in full stack web development. I already kind of am comfortable with these skills:</p>

          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would like to work as a front end web developer by early to mid next year.</p>
